#Hangman
This is a hangman game that I wrote in python using the graphics.py library

##Instructions
This is hangman... not sure if much more need be said, but in case you haven't heard you're supposed to guess letters that complete the word but you have a limited number of attempts before you are hung. It's honestly a very morbid game that we teach our kids in case they are kidnapped by a crazed english professor who refuses to let them go unless they have a solid vocabulary.
